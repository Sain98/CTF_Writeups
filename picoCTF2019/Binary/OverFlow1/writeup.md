# PicoCTF 2019 - Binary Exploit - Overflow1

Simple buffer overflow,
the actual vulnerability is inside the function 'vuln'

## The vulnerability
it calls 'gets', a function that is known the be very dangerous (it even says it in the man page to never use this function)
The reason this function is dangerous is because of how it works:
'gets(char \*s)  reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with a null byte ('\\0').  No check for buffer overrun is performed'
So it keeps reading input, even if this is way bigger then the amount of memory allocated for that string
Causing it the overwrite values from the stack

## Exploiting it
The plan is to overwrite the return address by overflowing the buffer and rewriting the values on the stack.

First we need to find the buffer (how many characters are allocated to fit in the given string)

We are given the source code so we can see the 'buffsize' variable which is the used buffer here for our string, so our string is allocated to hold 64 characters

so if we give as input a string of 64 characters + 4 characters we are overflowing our buffer.. yay :)

but we arent overwriting our return pointer yet, its still a few bytes out of range!

if we dissassembly and go through the 'vuln' function step by step we can see the return address gets loaded from [ebp-0x4]
so lets walk through the program

___Registers note___;
__esp__ = the stack pointer; it points to where the stack begins (the 'top' of the stack)

__ebp__ = the stack frame pointer;

The stack grows from esp -> ebp -> and past it (we actually overwrite ebp aswell in this overflow)

As you can see, using a string "A" of length 64 we are still, 3 addresses of overwriting the return pointer to main
The address we want to overwrite is  0x08048705 - it points to main+103
so we need to add 12 bytes to our overflow + another 4 of the address we want to jump to which is the flag function ( located @ 0x080485e6 )

Here is another picture of a slighlty modified overflow the string used was
"A" * 64 + "B" * 12

As you can see adding the 12 more bytes puts the main address (0x08048700) right next to us (idk why it now points to main+98 and +103 earlier) now all that is left is to write the remaining 4 bytes as a address to the function we want

now to write our exploit script, i will be using python & pwntools 
(note: this is setup to work locally, if you want it to work on the picoCTF server check exploit.py -i couldnt get the script to work properly using the pwntools ssh so you are supposed to run it manually now);

```
from pwn import *
# Flag function is located @ 0x080485e6
flag_function = util.packing.p32(0x080485e6)
# overwrite our buffer + the 3 other addresses we dont need
buff = "A" * 64 + "B" * 12
payload = buff + flag_function
p = process("./vuln")
p.recvuntil("")
p.sendline(payload)
print p.recvall()
```
